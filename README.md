## Concept

- [x] sources provide feeds
- [x] feeds have an requestUpdate() method
- [x] feeds have an "updated" event
- [x] feeds have a "items" property (array)
- [x] a model has sources and filters
- [x] a model derives its feeds from its sources
- [ ] a model has a view
- [ ] a view has a list of displayed items
- [ ] when a feed raises its "updated" event, a listening model updates its view's displayed items
