title: FeedTicker available on addons.mozilla.org
---

FeedTicker has passed through mozilla's preliminary review and is now available on [addons.mozilla.org][1] (AMO).

Since version 43, Firefox automatically disabled the addon because it was not signed by mozilla. The only way to enable it again was to edit `about:config` to disable signature enforcement. With the release on AMO, this will no longer be necessary.

To install it, simply go to [addons.mozilla.org][1] add click "Add to Firefox". If you already have FeedTicker installed, remove the old version first. You won't lose existing feed subscriptions.
