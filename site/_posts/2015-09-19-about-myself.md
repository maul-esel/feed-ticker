## Hi there!

Just wanted to give you some idea as to who's behind FeedTicker: I am.

The name is Dominik Klumpp, a 20 year old student from Germany, specifically the
region of Stuttgart. I study computer sciences at the University of Augsburg, and
as if that wasn't enough (it isn't), I do some more programming in my spare time
-- such as this project -- across a bunch of languages, starting from the awesome
[AutoHotkey][1] (sadly Windows-only), over C# and Java to Ruby and [CoffeeScript][2]
(which FeedTicker is written in).

That covers the basics, really. If you have similar interests, you may sometimes
find me on related websites under the alias [@maul-esel][3] (or maul.esel).

**So long!**
