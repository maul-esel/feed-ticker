## Adding feeds
To add a feed to FeedTicker, just subscribe to it using Firefox' *Live Bookmarks*
feature. FeedTicker will automatically notice new subscriptions and update its
toolbar to show the feed's contents.

## Found something interesting?
If you see an item in the toolbar that piques your interest, hover over it with
your mouse. A small popup will show a short summary of its contents, allowing you
to decide if you want to read the rest.

## Finding out more
To go to the URL of a feed entry, just click on it -- FeedTicker will open it in
a new tab. To get up-to-date on an entire feed, left-click any item and select
`Open feed in tabs` -- it does just what it says. Similarly, select `Open all in
tabs` from the context menu or the toolbar button to open everything.

## Dismiss old news
You may find only some entries in a feed worth your interest -- maybe you have read
others already somewhere else, or you just don't care for them. To get rid of them
and clear your view for what really interests you, select an item you don't want
to see any more and choose `Mark as read` from the context menu. As before, that
also works for an entire feed or all items at once.

## Customize FeedTicker
FeedTicker offers some preferences you may want to configure. Just open the addons
tab in Firefox and modify the settings to fit your needs.
